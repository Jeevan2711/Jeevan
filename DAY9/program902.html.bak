In this code, the <label> element is used to associate a label with an input field. The for attribute in the <label> element specifies which input field the label is associated with. The id attribute in the input fields is used to uniquely identify them.

You can add more fields to the form as needed and customize the appearance and behavior using CSS and JavaScript.
