   <h1>Defining a fish is difficult because the term fish includes a very wide range of aquatic animals. In fact, there are about as many species of fishes than there are of all other vertebrates combined (Fig. 4.4). Of the nearly 50,000 species of animals with backbones, approximately 4,500 are mammals, 9,700 are birds, 6,500 are reptiles, 4,000 are amphibians, and 25,000 are fishes. Although these numbers change as new species are discovered, new fishes are found more often than other new vertebrates are found. As scientists make new discoveries, it is expected that the number of species of fishes will outnumber other vertebrates even more.
